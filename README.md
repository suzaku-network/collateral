# Suzaku Collateral

This repository contains a Suzaku Collateral interface and its default implementation.

## Collateral

**Collateral** is a concept introduced by [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi) that brings capital efficiency and scale by enabling assets used to secure networks to be held outside of the restaking protocol itself - e.g. in DeFi positions on networks other than Ethereum itself.

The Collateral interface can be found [here](./src/interfaces/ICollateral.sol).

## Default Collateral

Default Collateral is a simple version of Collateral that has an instant debt repayment, which supports only non-rebase underlying assets.

The implementation can be found [here](./src/contracts/defaultCollateral).

## Technical Documentation

Technical documentation can be found in the [symbioticfi/collateral](https://github.com/symbioticfi/collateral/tree/main/specs) repository.

## Security
